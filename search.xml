Suppose we have a electric field and we bring in that the electric field a surface, an open surface, and I carve this surface up in very small elements, each with size $dA$, a very teeny weeny area.<br><fancybox><br><img src="https://img.vim-cn.com/bf/fecb2f15325975f10e5d3e6f2ea854f2c797e3.jpg" alt><br></fancybox></p><a id="more"></a><p>Then we take a direction as the normal $\hat{n}$.  And at that location, the local electric field may be $\vec{E}$. Hence the electric flux $d\phi$ go through the little surface $dA$ is defined as the dot product of $E$ and the vector perpendicular to this element.</p><blockquote><p>$d\phi=\vec{E}\cdot\hat{n}\cdot dA=\vec{E}\cdot \vec{dA}=E\cdot dA\cdot cos(\theta)$</p><p>$\vec{dA}$ is a vector whose magnitude equals the area of the little surface and its direction is equivalent to the unit normal vector $\hat{n}$. And $\theta$ is the angle between those two vectors.</p></blockquote><p>Apparently, $d\phi$ is a scalar. The number can be larger, smaller than zero, and it can be zero. The SI unit of flux follows immediately from the definition $N\cdot C^{-1}\cdot m^2$.</p><p>And in this case you can calculate the flux through the entire surface by doing an integral.</p><blockquote><p>$\phi=\int\vec{E}\cdot \vec{dA}$</p></blockquote><p>Now we take a surface which is not open as the one we’ve talked above. It’s a completely closed surface like a potato or balloon.</p><fancybox><p><img src="https://img.vim-cn.com/a0/d1d9128d2504dcb3ef3541745263820c33d897.jpg" alt></p></fancybox><p><strong>Here we notice by convention the normal to the surface, locally to the surface, is always from the inside of the surface to the outside world.</strong> </p><p>It’s uniquely determined because it’s a close surface. For the open surface, which is not uniquely determined, we can abitrarily chose one but we could have flipped it over a hundred eighty degrees.</p><p>And now we can calculate the total flux through the closed surface by doing a integral over the closed surface.</p><blockquote><p>$\phi =\oint \vec{E}\cdot \vec{dA}$</p></blockquote><p>Also the flux  $\phi$  is a scaler. It can be zero, positive or negative. If you think it as air, also flows out. If more flows out than flows in, then it’s positive. If more flows in than flows out, it’s negative.</p><p>Now let’s calculate the flux for a small case where I have a point charge $Q_+$. And I take a sophere as its closed surface, which has radius $R$. Pick out a small element $\vec{dA}$, which is radially outward. Electric field $\vec{E}$ at that point is also radial.</p><fancybox><p><img src="https://img.vim-cn.com/87/50b24a403a79e6b7388b2dab6c2cd25848cf82.jpg" alt></p></fancybox><p>Since it’s sphere, the $\vec{E}$ in magnitude is everywhere the same, the distance is the same and the $\vec{dA}$ and $\vec{E}$ are parallel. The total flux through the spherical closed surface is simply the area of the surface of that sphere times $E_R$.</p><blockquote><p>$\phi =4\pi R^2E_R=4\pi R^2\frac{Q_+}{4\pi R^2\epsilon_0}=\frac{Q_+}{\epsilon_0}$</p><p>It’s independent of $R$, the size of the sphere. </p><p>The flux is given by the charge which is at the center divided by $\epsilon_0$.</p></blockquote><p>Now if we had chosen some other shape, not a sphere, but I have dented it, it clear that would be the same like the air flows out as the case in sphere.</p><h2 id="The-Gauss’s-Law"><a href="#The-Gauss’s-Law" class="headerlink" title="The Gauss’s Law"></a>The Gauss’s Law</h2><p>The Gauss’s Law tells us that the electric flux going through the closed surface is sum of all charges inside the surface, that you may choose at any time you pick that surface, divided by $\epsilon_0$.</p><blockquote><p>$$\phi = \oint\vec{E}\cdot\vec{dA}=\frac{\sum{Q_{ins}}}{\epsilon_{0}} $$</p><p>This is the first of four equations of Maxwell.</p></blockquote><p>So electric flux through any closed surface is always the charge inside that closed surface divided by $\epsilon_0$. And if that flux happens to be zero, it means there is not net charge inside the closed surface. Gauss’s  Law always holds no matter how wired the charge distribution inside that closed surface.</p><p>But Gauss’s Law won’t help too much if you don’t have a situation whereby the charges are distributed in a very <strong>symmetric</strong> way. Gauss’s Law holds but it doesn’t do any good if you want to calculate the electric field.</p><p>So the forms of symmetry will help a lot when you want to calculate the electric field.</p><h3 id="Example-one"><a href="#Example-one" class="headerlink" title="Example one"></a>Example one</h3><h4 id="Spherical-symmetry"><a href="#Spherical-symmetry" class="headerlink" title="Spherical symmetry"></a>Spherical symmetry</h4><h5 id="Spherical-ball"><a href="#Spherical-ball" class="headerlink" title="Spherical ball"></a>Spherical ball</h5><fancybox><p><img src="https://img.vim-cn.com/29/d76d8c3b682781a249ef3dc4af44df29dd8c20.jpg" alt></p></fancybox><p>Now if we go to the spherical which is inside the shell and we know that $E$ is radially outwards apart from a plus or minus sign, apart from the fact that the angle between $\vec{dA}$ and $\vec{E}$, could either be zero degrees or one hundred eighty degrees. </p><p>We know that the surface area times electric field is $4\pi r^2E=\frac{Q_{ins}}{\epsilon_0}$. There is no $Q_{ins}$ in this case, so the $E$ must be zero! It’s a nontrival and amazing result! </p><p><strong>Because it means anywhere as it is still in the shell no matter what radius you choose, the electric field equals zero.</strong> Notice that there is another simliar situation in thin shell which gravity is zero no matter any place you choose as long as it is inside the shell.</p><p>In this case the symmetry arguments take into account that the charge is uniformly distributed. If the charge on the sphere had not been uniformaly distributed, we could not use the symmetry arguments, and therefore the electric field inside would in fact not have been zero.  </p><p>Now we go larger $r$ which is outside of the shell, we take the closed spherical surface and according to the equation provided by Gauss’s Law, we have $E=\frac{Q_+}{4\pi r^2\epsilon_0}$.</p><p>We’ve seen this form before. If we had put all the charges right at the middle at the center, we would’ve gotten exactly the same answer. <strong>In other words, whether the charge is uniformly distriburted over a sphere, or whether the charge is , all of it, exactly right at the center of the sphere, that make no difference for $E$ as long as you’re outside the sphere.</strong></p><p>Gauss’s Law and Coulomb’s Law in a way are the same law, they both linked the electric field with the charge. The key is the electric force fall of as one over $r^2$.  If it doesn’t fall off as one over $r^2$, then Gauss’s Law would not even hold. And the electric field inside the uniformly charged thin shell would not be zero. <strong>SO it’s the immediate consequence of the fact that electric forces fall off</strong> as one over $r^2$.</p><p>###Example two</p><h4 id="cylindrical-symmetry"><a href="#cylindrical-symmetry" class="headerlink" title="cylindrical symmetry"></a>cylindrical symmetry</h4><h5 id="A-flat-horizontal-plane-uniformly-charged-distributions"><a href="#A-flat-horizontal-plane-uniformly-charged-distributions" class="headerlink" title="A flat horizontal plane uniformly charged distributions"></a>A flat horizontal plane uniformly charged distributions</h5><p>Let’s suppose a infinitely large flat, extraordinary large,  uniformly charged distributed, and put a certain amount of charge density which calls $\sigma=\frac{Q}{A_{flat}}$. </p><p>If we now pick a clever Gauss surface, the answer pops out very quickly that how does the electric field distribute.  The answer is $\frac{Q_+}{2\epsilon_0}$</p><fancybox><p><img src="https://img.vim-cn.com/b6/5fd9b8f2364760fd8284f799ffb40e5fea91e2.jpg" alt></p></fancybox><p>And this result is relatively to the linear size of that surface, if the flat is not infinitely large, then the $E$ would not go straight out of flat plane. You only have two contribution from those two planes, top and bottom.</p><h5 id="The-configuration-of-a-charged-plane’s-electric-field"><a href="#The-configuration-of-a-charged-plane’s-electric-field" class="headerlink" title="The configuration of a charged plane’s electric field"></a>The configuration of a charged plane’s electric field</h5><fancybox><p><img src="https://img.vim-cn.com/d7/573fb8594ed2407fa03e3029c427338428696b.jpg" alt></p></fancybox><h3 id="Example-two"><a href="#Example-two" class="headerlink" title="Example two"></a>Example two</h3><h4 id="Two-charged-planes"><a href="#Two-charged-planes" class="headerlink" title="Two charged planes."></a><strong>Two charged planes.</strong></h4><fancybox><p><img src="https://img.vim-cn.com/3a/0e0b77473821db5fb2d613c2e37cedf82518ef.jpg" alt></p></fancybox><p>Clearly that near the end of the two plane the $E\ne 0$, because you can’t use Gauss Law since it’s not symmetric at that area. </p><p><font color="#00008B"><strong>Keywords of this article: Electric flux, Gauss’s law and the examples</strong></font></p>]]></content>

And there is a seperation bewteen the two which is $r$.</p><p>Now we can introduce the idea of electric field for which we write the symbol capital $E$.</p><blockquote><p>$$\vec{E_p}=\frac{\vec{F}}{q},\quad \vec{F_p}=\frac{kQq}{r^2}\hat{r}$$</p><p>$$\vec{E_p}=\frac{kQ}{r^2}\hat{r}$$</p></blockquote><p>Electric field  (strength) $E$ is a vector. By convention, we say the $E$ is away from $Q$ if $Q$ is positive, if $Q$ is negative, the force is in the other direction, and therefore $E$ is in the other direction.</p><p>And here is the key that the force in location $p$ depends on the test charge $q$  while electric field does not. The electric field is a representation for what happens around the charge plus $Q_+$.</p><h3 id="The-graphical-representations"><a href="#The-graphical-representations" class="headerlink" title="The graphical representations"></a>The graphical representations</h3><p>Here is an example of a charge $+3$ and charge $-1$.</p><fancybox><p><img src="https://img.vim-cn.com/1b/b7ae9057a4182f68aff5aee185ab2d7304d408.jpg" alt></p></fancybox><h3 id="The-superposition-principle-of-Q-i"><a href="#The-superposition-principle-of-Q-i" class="headerlink" title="The superposition principle of $Q_i$"></a>The superposition principle of $Q_i$</h3><p>if we have several charges, the $E=\sum\limits_{i}E_{i}$</p><fancybox><p><img src="https://img.vim-cn.com/8a/e21b5a6dfbf5ef02af1b96cceacad53e31fdfa.jpg" alt></p></fancybox><p>Is it obvious that superposition principle work? No. Does it works? Yes! How do we know it works? Because it’s consistent with all our experimental results. So we take the superposition principle for granted and that is acceptable.</p><h2 id="The-electric-field-lines"><a href="#The-electric-field-lines" class="headerlink" title="The electric field lines"></a>The electric field lines</h2><p>The electric field lines are something imagined, but it shows some information of the electric field $E$ . Every tangent direction of the point which lies in the electric field demonstrate the direction of the force. And the number of  lines show the electric strength of this area. The more, the stronger.</p><h2 id="The-charge-configuration"><a href="#The-charge-configuration" class="headerlink" title="The charge configuration"></a>The charge configuration</h2><p>The force in the electric field is always like this $\vec{F}=q\vec{E}$. Doesn’t matter the $q$ is positive, then the same direction as $E$. If it is negative it will be the opposite direction as $E$. If $q$ is large, then the force will be large, and if it is small, then the force will be small.</p><p>So the real secret behind the concept of an $E$ field is that you bring any charge at that location and you know what force acts at that point on that charge.</p><p>Let’s see these two charges that one is $+3$ and the other is $-1$. If you put a test charge ,here we suppose it is positive, very close to the negative charge, then the force is oriented to the negative charge. It’s attractive force due to the effect of the two charges. </p><p>But when you move that test charge very far away from the two charges, the situation changes.  It’s equivalent to a single $+2$ charges. The force turn out to be a  repulsion, which fall off at a speed of $r^2$, one over distance  square.  And in other cases which we can demonstrate, one postive charge and one negative charge fall off at a speed of $r^3$, one over the distance cubed.</p><fancybox><p><img src="https://img.vim-cn.com/34/900b530965664c17af977464d39c515dd6a220.jpg" alt></p></fancybox><p>You can sort of think as these field lines if you want to imagine the configuration that the plus charges blow out air like a hairdryer, and that the minus suck in air like a vacuum cleaner.</p><h2 id="The-induction-and-the-dipole"><a href="#The-induction-and-the-dipole" class="headerlink" title="The induction and the dipole"></a>The induction and the dipole</h2><fancybox><p><img src="https://img.vim-cn.com/8a/430179e411824a1421ad897f8a9f6514326bc5.jpg" alt><br></p></fancybox><p></p><p>When we put a negatively charged rod nearly around two contacted metal balls, the electrons want to go away, so the right side ball will be negatively charged and at the same time the left side will be automatically postively charged. So when we seperate the two metal balls by insulated ways, the two balls become a dipole when we take them apart.</p><p><font color="#00008B"><strong>Keywords of this article : Electric field ,the charge configuration, and the dipole</strong></font></p>]]></content>

So in other words, on nuclear scale $10^{-14}$ meters, very important are the nuclear forces; on an atomic scale up to thousands of kilmeters, it’s really electric forces that hold our world together. But on much larger scale, planets and the galaxy, it is gravity that holds our world together.</p><h2 id="Positive-and-negative-charges"><a href="#Positive-and-negative-charges" class="headerlink" title="Positive and negative charges"></a>Positive and negative charges</h2><h3 id="The-brief-history"><a href="#The-brief-history" class="headerlink" title="The brief history"></a>The brief history</h3><p>Already in 600 hundred BC, it was known that if you rub amber that it can attract pieces of dry leaves. And the Greek word for amber is electron, so that’s where electricity got its name from. </p><p>In the 16 centuries there were more substances known to do this. For instance glass and sulfur. It was also konwn and written that when people were bored at parties that the women would rub their amber jewelry and would touch frogs which then would start jumping of desperation, which people considered to be fun, not understanding what was actually happening to the amber nor what was happening to the frogs.</p><p>In the 18 centuries it was discovered that there are two types of electricity:</p><p>One if you rub glass and another if you rub rubber or amber for that matter, due to Benjamin Frankin without any knowledge of electrons and protonsw who introduced the idea that all substances are penetrated with what he called electric fluid, electric fire. And he stated it if you get too much of the fire the you’re positively charged and if you have a deficiency of that fire the you’re negatively charged.</p><p>He introduced the sign convention and he decided that if you rub glass that is an excess of fire and be called that therefore positive. (You will see later why this choice, he had fifty percent chance, is extremely unfortunate but we have to live with it.)</p><p><strong>You cannot create charge, if you create plus then automatically create mius.</strong></p><p><strong>Plus and plus repel each other, minus and minus repel each other. And plus and minus attract.</strong></p><h2 id="Forces-Coulomb’s-law"><a href="#Forces-Coulomb’s-law" class="headerlink" title="Forces-Coulomb’s law"></a>Forces-Coulomb’s law</h2><p>If we take two charges and we use in general for charge the symbol Q.  And Coulomb, the French physicist, who did a lot of research on this in the 18th~19th centuries actually. </p><p>In the SI units we will use for the unit of charge the coulomb named after this great man.  <strong>One coulomb charge is a horrendous amount if charge!</strong> More than you ever see in your life time.</p><p> So let’s see  the  Coulombs’s Law, the force on charge number two due to one :</p><blockquote><p>$$\vec{F_{1,2}}=\frac{KQ_1Q_2}{r^2}\hat{r}_{1,2}$$ </p><p>And the coulomb’s constant $K$ in SI units is  $9\times10^9 $  $ N·m^2/c^2$,  (for historical reasons, the $K$ is also equals $\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}$,  this $\epsilon_0$ called the permittivity of free space), the $\hat{r}_{1,2}$ is the unit vector from 1 to 2.</p></blockquote><p> The charge of one proton, which is exactly the same as the charge of one electron, is approximately $1.6\times 10^{-19}$ C.</p><h3 id="The-Coulomb-Force-and-the-Gravity"><a href="#The-Coulomb-Force-and-the-Gravity" class="headerlink" title="The Coulomb Force and the Gravity"></a>The Coulomb Force and the Gravity</h3><h4 id="Compare-them-by-computing"><a href="#Compare-them-by-computing" class="headerlink" title="Compare them by computing"></a>Compare them by computing</h4><p>Notice that there is a clear parallel with gravity.</p><p>Newton’s law of gravity:</p><blockquote><p>$\vec{F_{1,2}}= - \frac{GM_1M_2}{r^2}\hat{r}_{1,2}$</p><p>$G=6.67259\times 10^{-11}$ $ N·m²/kg²$ is the gravitational constant.</p></blockquote><p>Comparing electricity with gravity,  you’ll see that electric forces are way more powerful than gravitational forces</p><p>Let’s caculate the magnitude of the forces by taking two protons, which are seperated by a distance $d$.</p><blockquote><p>$F_{e}=\frac{KQQ}{d^2}=\frac{9 \times 10^9 \times (1.6\times 10^{-19})^2}{d^2}$</p><p>$F_g=\frac{Gmm}{d^2}=\frac{6.67 \times 10^{-11}\times(1.7\times 10^{-27})^2}{d^2}$</p><p>$\frac{F_e}{F_g}\approx36$</p></blockquote><p>So the electric force is 36 orders of magnitude more potent than the gravitational attraction! </p><h4 id="The-nuclear-forces"><a href="#The-nuclear-forces" class="headerlink" title="The nuclear forces"></a>The nuclear forces</h4><p>The nucleus has a size of about $10^{-14}$ meters, and the atom itself is about ten thousand times larger. The cloud of electrons which is about $10^{-10}$ meters.</p><p>Let’s think about $a_p=\frac{F_{electricity}}{M_P}$</p><p>If you make $d=10^{-14} $  $m^2$, and you calculate the ratio you will find it is 26 orders of magnitude higher than the graviton acceleration on the earth. So you wonder what the hell holds the nucleus together. If there is such a tremendous force on these protons.  Well thats nuclear forces, which we do not fully understand yet.</p><h2 id="The-Polarizations"><a href="#The-Polarizations" class="headerlink" title="The Polarizations"></a>The Polarizations</h2><p>Conductors have a small fraction of their electrons which are not bound to atoms but which we can freely move around in the conductor. That’s a characteristic for a conductor, for metals.  While that’s not the case with nonconductors there the all electrons are fixed to individual atoms.</p><p>The electrons want to be attracted by positive charges. When you use a conductor approaching positive charges, some of (very subtle) these electrons will move to the closer side to  the positive charges. Then the closer side is negative and the other side is positive. This process we call induction. It’s sort of a polarization. And by the way, in the nonconductors’ cases, the things described above are still the same, but much more subtle.</p><p><font color="#00008B"><strong>Keywords of this article : Electric charges , Forces-Coulomb’s law and Polarizations</strong></font></p>]]></content>
